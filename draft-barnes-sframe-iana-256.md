--- abstract

This document addresses two omissions in the Secure Frames (SFrame) protocol
specification.  First, the definition of the IANA registry for SFrame
ciphersuites omits several important fields.  This document requests that IANA
add those fields and defines the contents of those fields for current entries.
Second, the AEAD construction based on AES-CTR and HMAC is defined only for
the 128-bit security level.  This document registers parallel constructions
at the 256-bit security level.

# Introduction

The Secure Frames (SFrame) protocol specification defines an IANA registry for
cipher suites.  The initial definition in {{Section 8.1 of !RFC9605}} is missing
several important fields.  This document requests that IANA add those fields and
defines the contents of those fields for current entries.  We also define new
entries that extend the SFrame CTR+HMAC construction to support AES-256.

This document addresses two omissions in the Secure Frames (SFrame) protocol
specification {{!RFC9605}}.  First, the definition in {{Section 8.1 of
!RFC9605}} of the IANA registry for SFrame ciphersuites omits several important
fields.  This document requests that IANA add those fields and defines the
contents of those fields for current entries.  Second, the AEAD construction
based on AES-CTR and HMAC (in {{Section 4.5.1 of !RFC9605}}) is defined only for
the 128-bit security level.  This document registers parallel constructions at
the 256-bit security level.

# Conventions and Definitions

# AES-256-CTR with HMAC-SHA512

{{Section 4.5.1 of !RFC9605}} defines a compound authenticated encryption
construction, using the unauthenticated CTR mode of AES for encryption and HMAC
for authentication.

The original specification only defines cipher suite values for instances of
this construction using AES-128-CTR and HMAC-SHA256.  The construction works the
same way when used with AES-256-CTR and HMAC-SHA512.  The only differences are
in the lengths of some SFrame-internal fields:

* The keys generated by SFrame-internal key derivation (`derive_key_salt`) are
  longer to match the needs of AES-256-CTR and HMAC-SHA512 (96 bytes vs 48 bytes
  for AES-128-CTR and HMAC-SHA256).

* The initial tag value `tag` in `compute_tag` is 64 bytes instead of 32 bytes.

Identifiers for cipher suites using AES-256-CTR and HMAC-SHA512 are defined in
{{cipher-suites}}.

# Security Considerations

The registry changes in this document have no affect on the security of SFrame.

The new algorithms registered by this document allow the CTR+HMAC construction
to be used in environments that require a 256-bit security level.

# IANA Considerations

This document makes two requests of IANA: Updating the columns in the "SFrame
Cipher Suites" registry and adding entries to the updated registry for the new
cipher suites defined in this document.

## "SFrame Cipher Suites" Registry Update

The SFrame Cipher Suites registry should be updated to add the following
columns:

* `Nh`: The size in bytes of the output of the hash function

* `Nka`: For cipher suites using the compound AEAD described in {{Section 4.5.1
  of RFC9605}}, the size in bytes of a key for the underlying encryption
  algorithm

* `Nk`: The size in bytes of a key for the encryption algorithm

* `Nn`: The size in bytes of a nonce for the encryption algorithm

* `Nt`: The overhead in bytes of the encryption algorithm (typically the size of
  a "tag" that is added to the plaintext)

The "Change Controller" entry should be removed.

{{new-cipher-suite-registry}} illustrates the new structure of the registry, and provides
the required values for the currently registered entries.

## Cipher Suites for AES-256-CTR with HMAC-SHA512 {#cipher-suites}

The following new entries should be added to the SFrame Cipher Suites registry:
